# Phishing-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning---Boosting

Overview
This project focuses on detecting phishing websites using advanced machine learning techniques, particularly boosting algorithms. The goal is to build a robust and accurate model to differentiate between legitimate and phishing websites, enhancing online security.

Project Highlights
Objective: Identify phishing websites with high accuracy using machine learning.
Techniques: Implemented boosting algorithms such as Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, and XGBoost.
Dataset: Utilized a publicly available dataset containing website features and labels (phishing or legitimate).
Results: Achieved [insert accuracy/performance metrics, e.g., 95% accuracy] in phishing detection using optimized models.
Evaluation: Conducted model evaluation with precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix analysis.
Key Features
Comprehensive data preprocessing, including feature engineering and handling missing values.
Comparison of boosting algorithms for performance evaluation.
Detailed visualization of results to understand model performance.
Code modularity for easy replication and experimentation.
Requirements
Python 3.7+
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost
